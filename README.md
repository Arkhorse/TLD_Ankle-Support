# Ankle-Support for *The Long Dark*

This is a mod for **The Long Dark** by Hinterland Studio, Inc.

It is based on [Ankle-Support](https://github.com/zeobviouslyfakeacc/Ankle-Support) ported by [zeobviouslyfakeacc](https://github.com/zeobviouslyfakeacc) and originally made by [WulfMarius](https://github.com/WulfMarius).
**Special thanks** to them for all their contributions!

## Description

Sprains in *The Long Dark* are based on slope. A common sprain risk is can be around 30%. The base game calculates certain factors to it, like sprinting or crouching, and when you are over-encumbered or exhausted. However, they added a total amount of 0.3% for over-encumbered or exhausted instead of the supposed 30%. So basically there is no penalty for being exhausted or over-encumbered a the moment. This mod fixes the problem with new configurable options in the mod settings. In addition to this and with the permission of [zeobviouslyfakeacc](https://github.com/zeobviouslyfakeacc) I added all the functionality of ankle support and made them also configurable. I.e. you can now add wrist protection and ankle protection to gloves or boots, respectively.

## Settings

There are four new settings in the *Mod Options*:

- **Ankle/ Wrist Support**
  - Boot Toughness Factor: `(Vanilla = 0, Recommended = 2)`
  
    *This value specifies how much each boot protection value reduces the ankle sprain probability percentage.*
  
  - Glove Toughness Factor: `(Vanilla = 0, Recommended = 4)`

    *This value specifies how much each glove protection value reduces the wrist sprain probability percentage.*
- **Sprain Probability**
  - Over-Encumbrance: `(Vanilla = 0, Recommended = 3)`
  
    *How much every kg of additional weight gets added to the sprain probability when the player is over-encumbered.*
  - Exhausted: `(Vanilla = 0.3, Recommended = 30)`
  
    *How much gets added to the sprain probability when the player is exhausted.*
