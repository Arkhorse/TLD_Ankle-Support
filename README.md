Ankle-Support


This is a mod for **The Long Dark** by Hinterland Games Studio, Inc.


All types of shoes and boots help prevent sprained ankles from falling and moving on uneven terrain. 

The strength of the support is derived from a shoes protection value:  
Each point in protection reduced the chance to receive a sprain by two per cent.


Requires the [Mod Loader](https://github.com/zeobviouslyfakeacc/ModLoaderInstaller) to run.
